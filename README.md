# Wisp
Wisp is a programming language designed specifically around WASM and its 
ecosystem. It's meant as a stop-gap between WAT and a more sophisticated
language, while still offering plenty of quality of life improvements and a
familiar language syntax.

Wisp's primary focus is to provide a high level abstraction of WASM,
while keeping it as simple as possible
